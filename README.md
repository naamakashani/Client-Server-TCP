# Ex4AP
this program conttains client,server and user.
the client send the server the user input.
the user input a number between 1-5 and 8 in order to exit.
each number do differernt thing. 
in order to run the file you need to write make command and the make file will compile the program.
for runnig the program you have to run server and client separatelt.
running server: write the commend: ./server.out port  
client: write the command: ./client.out ip port (e.g 127.0.0.1 (local host) 50006) make sure that the port given as argument is the same for client and server!!
our code is working when the client send to the server the path instead of the content.
we try to do extracting in other branch named extractPath the content is extracted but we had problem in the classifiction.
